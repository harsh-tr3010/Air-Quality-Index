🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using multiple machine learning and deep learning regression techniques. The goal is to compare different models and evaluate their performance in predicting AQI based on environmental parameters.

The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison using both traditional ML algorithms and neural networks.
